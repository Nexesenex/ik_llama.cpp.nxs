#### Description

Needed this for some quants and realized it didn't support it already, so figured I'd just PR upstream  
Seems a bit odd to need to figure out model families by vocab size? But I'm not sure of a better way to do it, so left it as-is for now

It is the only model that has a vocabulary of 155,136 tokens?
